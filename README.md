# groovy-cli-bazel-sqlserver-ssl-pivot

## Description
Creates a small database table
called `dog`. This table, `dog`, has been normalized to 3NF.
Two new tables have been added, `breedLookup` and `colorLookup`.
Creates a new table `dog_expanded` that joins
`dog`, `breedLookup` and `colorLookup`. Added clustered indexes on
`dog`.breedId and `dog`.colorId. Turned `dog_expanded` into a view. Using
PIVOT with the aggregate function
COUNT, create a new view `breed_count`. All output normally
seen in a terminal will be in `groovy-srv/log` which will dump to the screen. The project may seem to hang but the logs from the container must be written to the project this can take up to 3 min.

Sql server uses self-signed ssl.
